I'll usually just say "data scientist". I'm also a minor in GIS, but I'll usually just say "digital cartographer" for that one
In the past month, what are the three main adjectives you have been doing at work? etc.

Over the winter, I was focusing on an online class - GEOG473, which dealt with spatial analysis concepts in GIS. Other than that, I've been adjusting to a new schedule this semester and have been focusing on keepin up with readings and doing homework for spring courses.

Keep names for files recognizable and simple. Make sure to keep files in their designated places. Make sure directories are specified.
